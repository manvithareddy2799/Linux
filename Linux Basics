🔹 1. What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system that acts as a bridge between hardware and software.
It manages system resources and allows users to interact with the computer through commands and applications.

🔸 Main Functions:
Manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.)
Provides file system and process management
Enables multi-user and multitasking

🔹 2. Linux Distributions
A distribution (distro) is a version of Linux that includes the kernel + tools + applications.
Some popular examples:
Distribution	Description
Ubuntu	Beginner-friendly, used in desktops and servers
Debian	Very stable, used as base for other distros
Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora	Common in enterprises
Kali Linux	Used for security testing
Arch Linux	Lightweight and customizable

🔹 3. Linux Login and Prompt Structure
When you open a terminal, you see something like:
user@host:~$
Meaning:
user → Logged-in username
host → Machine name (hostname)
~ → Represents the home directory of the user (/home/user)
$ → Normal user prompt
# → Root (administrator) prompt

Example:
test@server:~$      → You are in /home/test
root@server:/#      → You are in root (administrator) mode

🔹 4. Switching Users and Directories
