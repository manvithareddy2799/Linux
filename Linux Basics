🔹 1. What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system that acts as a bridge between hardware and software.
It manages system resources and allows users to interact with the computer through commands and applications.

🔸 Main Functions:
Manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.)
Provides file system and process management
Enables multi-user and multitasking

🔹 2. Linux Distributions
A distribution (distro) is a version of Linux that includes the kernel + tools + applications.
Some popular examples:
Distribution	Description
Ubuntu	Beginner-friendly, used in desktops and servers
Debian	Very stable, used as base for other distros
Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora	Common in enterprises
Kali Linux	Used for security testing
Arch Linux	Lightweight and customizable

🔹 3. Linux Login and Prompt Structure
When you open a terminal, you see something like:
user@host:~$
Meaning:
user → Logged-in username
host → Machine name (hostname)
~ → Represents the home directory of the user (/home/user)
$ → Normal user prompt
# → Root (administrator) prompt

Example:
test@server:~$      → You are in /home/test
root@server:/#      → You are in root (administrator) mode

🔹 4. Switching Users and Directories
| Command       | Description            | Example     |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `sudo su -`   | Switch to root user    | `sudo su -` |
| `su username` | Switch to another user | `su manvi`  |
| `cd /`        | Go to root directory   |             |
| `cd /home`    | Go to home directory   |             |
| `pwd`         | Show current directory |             |

Switch to root user:
sudo su -
(- loads root’s environment and moves you to /root)

📁 4. Important Linux Directories (under /)
| Directory | Description                            | Example                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/`       | Root directory (top-level)             | Everything starts from `/`            |

| `/data`   | (Optional) Custom mount point for data | Mounted drives                        |

Shortcut Directories:
/bin → /usr/bin
/sbin → /usr/sbin
/lib → /usr/lib

🧩 5. Basic Commands

| `echo "Hi" >> file.txt`   | Append text                         |

👥 7. User and Group Management
Add user (non-interactive, scripting):
useradd manvi
→ does not create /home/manvi automatically.

Add user (interactive):
adduser manvi
→ creates /home/manvi and asks for password.

Check users:
cat /etc/passwd

Set password:
passwd manvi

Encrypted passwords: stored in /etc/shadow
→ Encrypted with SHA-512, cannot be decrypted.

Create group:
groupadd dev

Add user to group:
usermod -aG dev manvi

🔐 8. File Permissions
Each file has three sets of permissions:
-rw-rw-r--

Symbol	Meaning
-	Regular file (if d → directory)
rw-	Owner (user) permissions
rw-	Group permissions
r--	Others’ permissions
Symbol	Permission	Description
r	Read	View file contents
w	Write	Modify file
x	Execute	Run as program/script

Change permissions:
chmod u=rwx file     # Full access for user
chmod g=rx file      # Read/execute for group
chmod o=r file       # Read-only for others
chmod u+x file       # Add execute to user
chmod g-w file       # Remove write from group

Change ownership:
chown user:group file
chown qa:qa test.sh


Default Permissions:
Folder: 755 → rwxr-xr-x
File: 644 → rw-r--r--
You need execute permission on a folder to enter it and read permission on files inside it.

⚙️ 9. Process Management
Process = a running program instance
Examples:
Running python app.py
Running a shell script
View processes:
ps -ef          # List all processes (basic)
ps aux          # Detailed (includes CPU, memory)
ps aux | nl     # Number the lines
ps aux | wc -l  # Count number of processes

Difference:
ps -ef → PID, PPID, CMD (no CPU/mem)
ps aux → includes CPU and memory columns

Kill/Stop/Resume:
ps aux | grep java | grep -v grep
kill PID          # Kill process
kill -9 PID       # Force kill
kill -STOP PID    # Pause process
kill -CONT PID    # Resume process

Change priority:
renice -n 10 -p PID   # Lower priority
renice -n -5 -p PID   # Higher priority (root only)

⚙️ 10. Services and Daemons
Daemon = background process that runs automatically.
Examples: sshd, crond, nginx

Service management:
systemctl list-units --type=service   # List services
systemctl start nginx                 # Start service
systemctl stop nginx                  # Stop service
systemctl enable nginx                # Start automatically on boot

📊 11. Monitoring System
| Command    | Purpose                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| `top`      | Real-time CPU, memory usage   |
| `htop`     | Same as top, better visual UI |
| `free -m`  | Memory usage in MB            |
| `free -h`  | Human readable                |
| `vmstat`   | System performance summary    |
| `nproc`    | Number of CPU cores           |
| `df -h`    | Disk usage for all mounts     |
| `du -sh`   | Disk usage of current folder  |
| `du -sh *` | Disk usage of all subfolders  |

Prometheus + Grafana
Prometheus: collects metrics from Linux (via Node Exporter)
Grafana: visualizes data with dashboards
Alerting: Email/slack alerts when usage crosses limits

💾 12. Disk Management
When storage fills up:
Add new volume (EBS)
Format → Mount → Use

Steps:
List disks:
lsblk
Format volume:
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf
Create mount directory:
mkdir -p /mnt/demo-volume
Mount the disk:
mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/demo-volume
Verify:
df -h
Unmount (if needed):
umount /mnt/demo-volume

Differences:
| Command   | Use                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `useradd` | Non-interactive user creation (for scripts) |
| `adduser` | Interactive user creation                   |
| `ps aux`  | Detailed process list (with CPU/Mem)        |
| `ps -ef`  | Simpler process list                        |
| `kill -9` | Force kill                                  |
| `renice`  | Change process priority                     |
| `df -h`   | Disk usage (mounted drives)                 |
| `du -sh`  | Disk usage (specific folder)                |
