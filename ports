ports:
🔹 1. What is a Port?
In computer networking, a port is a logical communication endpoint that helps identify specific processes or services on a device.

When two systems communicate over a network:
The IP address identifies which system to reach.
The port number identifies which service or process on that system to communicate with.

🏠 Simple Analogy
Imagine your computer as a big apartment building:
The IP address is the building’s address.
The ports are different doors to various rooms in that building.
Each door (port) leads to a different service:
Door 22 → SSH room
Door 80 → Web browsing room
Door 25 → Email room
So when someone wants to reach your computer for a specific service, they must know which door (port) to use.

🔹 2. How Ports Work
When two computers talk over a network:
They connect using IP address (to find each other).
They use a port number (to know which service or program to talk to).

For example:
ssh user@192.168.1.10
Here:
192.168.1.10 → IP address (which computer to contact)
Port 22 (default for SSH) → which service to use on that computer
So, SSH uses port 22 by default.

🔹 3. Port Number Range
Every computer has 65,536 ports — numbered from 0 to 65535.
They’re divided into 3 categories:
| Range             | Name                        | Used For                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **0 – 1023**      | **Well-known ports**        | Common services (used by system programs)          |
| **1024 – 49151**  | **Registered ports**        | Used by software and applications                  |
| **49152 – 65535** | **Dynamic / Private ports** | Temporary ports used by clients during connections |


🔹 4. Common Port Numbers You Should Know
| Service                          | Protocol | Default Port | Purpose                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| **SSH**                          | TCP      | **22**       | Secure remote login      |
| **HTTP**                         | TCP      | **80**       | Web traffic (non-secure) |
| **HTTPS**                        | TCP      | **443**      | Secure web traffic       |
| **FTP**                          | TCP      | **21**       | File Transfer            |
| **SMTP**                         | TCP      | **25**       | Sending email            |
| **DNS**                          | UDP      | **53**       | Domain name lookup       |
| **MySQL**                        | TCP      | **3306**     | Database access          |
| **RDP (Windows Remote Desktop)** | TCP      | **3389**     | Remote desktop access    |

🔹 6. Custom (Non-Default) Ports
For extra security, system administrators often change the default port number.

For example:
Instead of using port 22, they might use 2222 or 5000 for SSH.
To connect then:
ssh -p 2222 user@192.168.1.10
(-p means port)
This makes it harder for attackers to find your SSH service.

🔹 4. How to Check Open Ports (Linux)
There are several useful commands for checking open ports.

🧩 A. netstat (older but still common)
sudo netstat -tuln
Options explained:
t → TCP
u → UDP
l → Listening sockets
n → Show numeric ports (not service names)

Output Example:
Proto  Local Address   Port   Service
tcp    0.0.0.0:22      22     sshd
tcp    0.0.0.0:80      80     httpd
tcp    0.0.0.0:443     443    https

or
B. ss (modern replacement for netstat)
sudo ss -tuln


Output Example:
Proto  Local Address   Port   Service
tcp    0.0.0.0:22      22     sshd
tcp    0.0.0.0:80      80     httpd
tcp    0.0.0.0:443     443    https
Same output, faster and more modern.

👉 Here:
Port 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open and listening.

C.nc (netcat — quick manual test)
Check if a remote host port is reachable:
nc -zv <ip-address> <port>
Example:
nc -zv 10.0.0.10 22

Output:
Connection to 10.0.0.10 22 port [tcp/ssh] succeeded!
This means SSH port is open.

You can also test port ranges:
nc -zv 10.0.0.10 20-80


🌐 When Your Web App Is Not Reachable — Simple Steps
Let’s say you deployed your web app (for example, running on port 8080) on a Linux server or EC2.
You open the browser and see:
❌ “This site can’t be reached”
Here’s what you should do step by step 👇

🔹 Step 1: Check if your app is running
Run this command:
sudo ss -tuln | grep 8080

If you see something like:
tcp  LISTEN  0  128  0.0.0.0:8080  ...

✅ It means your app is running and listening on port 8080.
If no result appears, your app is not running — restart it.

🔹 Step 2: Check if it works inside the server
Try accessing it locally on the server:
curl http://localhost:8080

If it shows a response (like HTML or “Hello World”) → your app is fine.
If it says “Connection refused” → your app is not running properly or is on the wrong port.

🔹 Step 3: Make sure your app listens on all network interfaces
In your app code or settings, make sure it listens on 0.0.0.0, not just 127.0.0.1.
| App Type           | Example Setting                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Flask (Python)     | `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)`               |
| Node.js            | `app.listen(8080, '0.0.0.0')`                      |
| Spring Boot (Java) | `server.address=0.0.0.0` in application.properties |
If your app is bound only to 127.0.0.1, it will only work inside the server — not from your browser.

🔹 Step 4: Check your cloud server’s firewall (for example AWS EC2)
Go to:
AWS Console → EC2 → Security Groups → Inbound Rules
Make sure you have a rule like this:
| Type       | Protocol | Port Range | Source    |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Custom TCP | TCP      | 8080       | 0.0.0.0/0 |
✅ This allows people (including you) to reach your app on port 8080.

🔹 Step 5: Try again from your computer
In your browser or terminal:

http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080
If it opens, 🎉 you’re done!

If it still doesn’t open:
Double-check port number (maybe your app runs on 3000 or 5000)
Recheck AWS inbound rules
Restart your app

🔹 Step 6: Optional – Restart SSH (if you changed network settings)
Sometimes after changes, SSH or network needs a quick restart:
sudo systemctl restart ssh

🔹 step:7. Kubernetes-Specific Check
If the app is inside Kubernetes:
Check if Pod exposes the port:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep Port

Check Service type and port mapping:
kubectl get svc

Example:
NAME     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)
webapp   NodePort    10.0.0.42      <none>        8080:30080/TCP


Access via:
http://<node-ip>:30080
